"""The single admissibility predicate for DoD evidence (OMN-15309).

Operator ruling 2026-07-29 (recorded in ``docs/tracking/ROLLING_WORK_LEDGER.md``,
"OPERATOR RULINGS x8", item 3): adopt the **OMN-14505 deploy-gate falsifiability
predicate** as THE admissibility rule for evidence everywhere, CI-enforced. This
module is that adoption. It is deliberately the *only* place in this repo where
"is this evidence admissible?" is decided.

Three properties, all required. Evidence is admissible only if it is:

1. **EXECUTED** — a command actually runs. Not a declaration, not an attestation,
   not a keyword appearing as quoted text. Decided by shell *command position*
   (``shlex``), never by substring match: ``echo 'docker exec x'`` lexes to
   ``['echo', 'docker exec x']``, so ``docker`` is an argument and never counts.
2. **FALSIFIABLE** — it can go RED. A probe whose exit status is fixed by the
   text the author typed (``echo``, ``true``, ``:``, ``printf``) proves nothing.
3. **OUTSIDE ITS OWN DIFF** — it observes something the evidence author does not
   write in the same change. Reading back the receipt/contract tree authored by
   the same OCC companion PR, or grepping only files the PR itself modifies, is
   circular: the check passes because the author wrote the text it greps.

Provenance — the cited single source
------------------------------------
The algorithm (shell lexing, command-position resolution, wrapper unwrapping,
``$(...)``/``bash -c`` recursion, the self-referential DENY list) is adopted from
``omniclaude/.github/actions/deploy-gate/validate_pr_deploy_required.py``
(``classify_check_value``), shipped under OMN-14505. That file remains the cited
source of the predicate; this module is its adoption in onex_change_control, and
``tests/test_evidence_admissibility.py`` plus the ``predicate-parity`` step in
``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` prove the two agree by **execution** against a
shared case corpus, so they cannot silently drift into a second definition.

Why the probe vocabulary is a parameter, not a constant
-------------------------------------------------------
The two consumers differ in exactly one respect, and it is a real difference, not
a second definition:

* ``deploy-gate`` **never executes** the check_value — it only reads the contract
  text — so "EXECUTED" can only be inferred from the *name* of the command. It
  therefore admits only :data:`LIVE_PROBE_COMMANDS`, whose exit status can only
  come from a deployed system.
* ``contract_compliance_check.py`` **does execute** the check_value in CI, so a
  hermetic command that runs against the product checkout (``uv run pytest``,
  ``python -c 'import ...'``, ``grep`` over a file the PR does not touch) is
  genuinely executed and genuinely falsifiable. It admits
  :data:`EXECUTED_HERMETIC_COMMANDS` in addition.

Both consumers apply the identical DENY half and the identical command-position
analysis. Only the ALLOW vocabulary is parameterised.

Fails CLOSED: empty, non-string, unparseable (unbalanced quotes), or
not-provably-executed input is INADMISSIBLE.
