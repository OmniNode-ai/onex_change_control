"""OMN-18236 — one acceptance-criterion binding, pinned and (maybe) accepted.

``binds_ac`` says which criteria an evidence item CLAIMS. It says nothing about
who agreed, or about which revision of the criterion was agreed to. Both
absences are load-bearing:

* **Nobody agreed.** The plan's first rule is that no name-based inference is
  authoritative — a check whose name resembles a criterion binds nothing. A
  mapping is data a reviewer or the evidence author accepted, never a string
  match a machine performed. Without a place to record that acceptance, a
  proposal and a reviewed binding are indistinguishable, which is why autobind
  may not propose at all today (OMN-18238).
* **Nothing said which revision.** A criterion can be rewritten under a check
  that is still passing, and the binding goes on reading as proof of a sentence
  that no longer exists.

A binding therefore carries the criterion's hash always, and an acceptance
record when it has one. A binding with no ``accepted_by`` is a DRAFT: a
proposal, not proof. A binding whose ``criterion_hash`` no longer matches the
ticket is STALE and reverts to unproven until somebody re-accepts it.

This model is OCC-LOCAL on purpose. The item-level field set the DoD verifier
validates against is owned by ``omnibase_core``'s ``ModelContractDodItem`` under
``extra="forbid"``, so a field declared only here is withheld before that model
sees it — the same forward-compatibility path ``binds_ac`` itself took. See
``withhold_unreleased_binds_ac`` in ``scripts/validate_yaml.py``.
