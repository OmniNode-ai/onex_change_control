CI/pre-commit check: fail-loud meta-gate over .pre-commit-config.yaml
(OMN-14672, WS7 fan-out #4 of the OMN-14655 canary; ported byte-for-byte from
omnibase_infra#2318 / omnimarket#1783 / omniclaude#1904 so every surface
enforces the identical rule).

DRIFT-2 (false-green hook) recurrence guard. The canary repo had gate wrappers
that silently degraded to a zero exit when a sibling script could not be
resolved -- a skipped gate that was byte-indistinguishable from a passing one.
This gate makes the fix a mechanism, not a one-off: it hard-fails (a) any gate
wrapper script that pairs a missing-dependency / WARN / SKIP signal with a
following zero exit (the recurring false-green shape), and (b) any hook
`stages:` value that `default_install_hook_types` does not cover, so a
pre-push/commit-msg hook can never silently go uninstalled again. In OCC this
second check is load-bearing on landing: the repo shipped
`default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, pre-push]` while the
`reject-deploy-gate-skip-token-commit-msg` hook declares `stages:[commit-msg]`
(DRIFT-2a), so the skip-token guard never installed locally.

Scope: only scripts actually referenced by a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
`entry:` for a `language: system` / `language: script` hook (plus the raw
`entry:` string itself, for inline `bash -c '...'` hooks). This deliberately
excludes unrelated automation under scripts/ (cron-*.sh, watchdog-*.sh, ...)
that are not pre-commit hooks at all.

Note: `_resolve_script` only follows `entry:` tokens under `scripts/` or
`.pre-commit-hooks/`, so this module (under `src/onex_change_control/scripts/`,
the canonical OCC home for validator scripts per OMN-14475, outside the
top-level `scripts/` DEFAULT-DENY guard) is not self-scanned. The prose still
deliberately avoids writing the detected token pair (a literal zero-exit
adjacent to a missing-path phrase) so nothing here can false-positive if the
scan scope is later widened.

Suppress a reviewed false positive with `# fail-loud-ok: <reason>` on the
flagged line.
