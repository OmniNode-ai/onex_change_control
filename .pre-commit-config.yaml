# ONEX Change Control Pre-commit Configuration
# Mirrors ONEX ecosystem settings for consistency
#
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
# =========================
# Two-stage validation strategy for optimal developer experience:
#
# PRE-COMMIT (target: <15 seconds):
#   - Formatting (ruff format/fix)
#   - Basic file checks (whitespace, large files, merge conflicts)
#
# PRE-PUSH (quick validation before sharing):
#   - mypy type checking (changed files only)
#
# Note: ruff replaces both black and isort (10-100x faster)
#
# USAGE:
#   pre-commit install                    # Install pre-commit hooks
#   pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push  # Install pre-push hooks
#   pre-commit run --all-files            # Run all pre-commit hooks

  # Essential file formatting (standard across ecosystem)
