"""Reliable merge-queue enqueue decision logic (OMN-13214).

Root cause this module addresses
--------------------------------
During the 2026-06-17 dev merge wave, many PRs reached ``mergeStateStatus=CLEAN``
with all required checks green AND auto-merge armed (by the "Enable Auto-Merge"
GitHub Actions job), yet never entered the dev merge queue. Each one needed a
manual ``enqueuePullRequest`` GraphQL mutation (or a disable+re-arm with bare
``--auto``) to actually land.

Arming auto-merge is **not** the same as enqueuing. On a queue-controlled repo a
PR can sit CLEAN + armed indefinitely without GitHub ever placing it in the
queue. The reliable path is an explicit ``enqueuePullRequest`` after arming,
followed by a verification that the PR actually entered the queue. On
strict-update (require-branches-up-to-date) repos a branch-behind PR silently
blocks enqueue with no auto ``update-branch`` step.

This module is the deterministic, unit-tested core of the workflow step. The
``auto-merge.yml`` workflow shells out to it to decide what action to take and to
verify the outcome; all the branching that is worth testing in isolation lives
here rather than in untestable bash.

The module performs **no** network I/O. The workflow is responsible for fetching
PR JSON via ``gh`` and passing it in; this module only classifies and decides.
