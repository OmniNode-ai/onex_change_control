"""lint_contract_check_values.py -- Pre-commit linter for fail-open patterns in
contract check_value fields.

Fail-open patterns cause DoD checks to pass when they should not:
  - `[ -z "$var" ] ||`  — empty-permissive short-circuit (truthy when var is absent)
  - `|| true`           — always-true tail
  - `|| exit 0`         — explicit pass on error
  - `2>/dev/null` at end of fragment (silenced errors without explicit exit check)

These patterns mask missing or failing gates and produce false positives.
The correct fail-closed form is simply `[ "$result" = "SUCCESS" ]`.

Also rejects legacy ``gh pr`` invocations that omit ``${PR_NUMBER}`` or a ``--repo``
argument.  These fail in detached-HEAD CI runs with "could not determine current
branch":

  - ``gh pr checks``          (bare — no PR number)
  - ``gh pr checks --watch``  (bare — no PR number)
  - ``gh pr checks 1430 ...`` (hardcoded integer PR number, mixed with ``${PR_NUMBER}``)
  - ``gh pr view {pr} ...``   (wrong-format ``{x}`` placeholder)

Correct form for checking THIS ticket's own PR:
``gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER} --repo ${REPO}``

Correct form for a genuine, deliberate reference to a DIFFERENT (sibling/dependency)
PR: a standalone hardcoded PR number with a literal ``--repo``, e.g.
``gh pr checks 1721 --repo OmniNode-ai/omnimarket`` — with NO ``${PR_NUMBER}``
anywhere in the same value (see OMN-14431: ``run_contract_compliance_check.py``'s
``_substitute_tokens`` pre-replaces every ``${PR_NUMBER}``/``${REPO}``/``${TICKET_ID}``
occurrence in the WHOLE check_value string with the runner's OWN values before
``sh -c`` ever runs — before any ``VAR=literal`` prefix assignment in the same
string could take effect. So a value like
``PR_NUMBER=1721 REPO=org/repo gh pr checks ${PR_NUMBER} --repo ${REPO}`` looks
like it pins PR 1721, but the ``${PR_NUMBER}`` token is already gone by the time
the shell would apply the assignment: the assignment is inert, and the check
silently runs against whatever PR the runner is evaluating instead of 1721).

Also rejects predicates pinned to a MUTABLE external state (OMN-15540 Rule F) --
a specific workflow run's ``.conclusion`` (rewritten by a re-run), a deletable
feature-branch ref (404s once the branch is deleted on merge), or an
exact/upper bound on an unanchored, monotonically growing ``search/issues``
count. See the Rule F block below for the measured corpus instances.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/lint_contract_check_values.py contracts/OMN-1234.yaml [...]

Exits non-zero if any fail-open, legacy-gh-pr, or mutable-state-pin pattern is
found.

# `contract_compliance_check._check_command`. A value that OPENS with English
# prose describing what was run ("Recorded product receipt: uv run pytest ...")
# is not a command at all -- `sh` fails on the first word with "command not
# found" (exit 127), so the check always BLOCKs when actually executed. This
# was the root defect behind OMN-15382 (3/7 dod_verify failures on
# contracts/OMN-14968.yaml): four items were authored as human-readable
# descriptions of a command that had already been run by hand, never as an
# executable command a hosted runner can re-run.
#
# The rule: strip any leading simple `VAR=literal` (no internal whitespace,
# no `$()`/quoting) env-assignment tokens, then require the first remaining
# token to be either a recognized command head or a POSIX shell
# control-flow/builtin keyword that can legitimately open a compound
# fragment (`if`, `case`, `for`, `!`, `[`, `:`, ...). A value that opens with
# `IDENTIFIER=` but whose value is NOT a bare literal (a command-substitution
# or quoted assignment, e.g. ``state=$(gh pr view ...)`` or
# ``f="$(mktemp)" && ...``) is a legitimate multi-statement shell fragment
# and is exempted rather than mis-tokenized by a non-shell-aware parser.

#       --jq '.number == 5408' | grep -qx true
#

# the SAME literal, so the assertion is `N == N` -- true by construction for
# every PR that exists. It cannot go RED for any product reason; only deleting
# the PR from GitHub would move it. Such an item is EXECUTED and looks
# ADMISSIBLE to the OMN-15309 predicate (it is a real command with a real exit
# code) while being unfalsifiable, which is precisely the false-green class
# OMN-15391 exists to retire.
#
# The rule: if an identity field (`.number` / `.id` / `.databaseId`) is
# compared for equality against a literal that ALSO appears as the PR/issue

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OMN-15540 Rule F: predicate pinned to a MUTABLE external state
#
# A check_value whose predicate can only ever be satisfied by an
# IMMUTABLE-PAST state. Two directions, one root cause -- the predicate is
# written against a surface that keeps moving:
#
#   1. It can NEVER pass, because the state it pins has already been erased
#      (a workflow re-run, a deleted branch). Deterministic BLOCK forever.
#   2. It pins a MUTABLE state as if it were immutable -- green today by luck,
#      permanent BLOCK the moment the surface moves. The thing that moves it is
#      usually the very repair the ticket exists to make.
#
# This is the opposite direction from OMN-14767's `check_contract_dod_authoring`
# "impossible pre-merge" class (`state == MERGED` asserted while the PR is still
# open), which is a TIMING defect that resolves itself on merge. Rule F's class
# never resolves: it gets worse with time.
#
# Why this matters beyond a red check: an unsatisfiable check produces an
# unresolvable red, which produces a "red-but-accepted" adjudication request,
# which spends operator judgement on a defect that was AUTHORED rather than
# discovered. Stopping the class stops the escalations.
#
# --- F1: a specific workflow run's `.conclusion`, asserted -------------------
# Job and run conclusions are REWRITTEN in place by "Re-run jobs" / "Re-run
# failed jobs" -- the run id is stable, the conclusion under it is not.
# Measured at authoring time (2026-07-30) on the corpus' own instance,
# contracts/OMN-15484.yaml: the check asserts run 30565261108's
# `occ-preflight / eligibility` concluded `failure`; the job had since been
# re-run and reads `success`, so `bash -o pipefail -c '<the literal bytes>'`
# exits 1. Nothing can ever make it exit 0 again.
#
# Pinning `failure` is the strictly-never-passable direction and is what the
# class is named for, but pinning `success` is flagged too: it is the same
# unstable read, green only until someone re-runs the job. The durable form
# records the observed conclusion in a receipt under drift/dod_receipts/ and
# asserts the receipt, or asserts a MONOTONE property of the run (the gate job
# exists / reported at all) rather than one transient verdict.
#
# --- F2: a deletable branch head pinned as a content ref --------------------
# GitHub deletes a PR head branch on merge, after which every
# `?ref=<that-branch>` fetch 404s forever. Corpus instance
# contracts/OMN-10765.yaml (dod-001/dod-002) pins
# `?ref=jonah/omn-10765-port-change-aware-test-selection-to-omniintelligence`;
# live readback returns `HTTP 404 -- No commit found for the ref`. This is the
# exact failure the `reference_never_pin_a_feature_branch_head` rule names:
# pin the SQUASH COMMIT on the mainline, never the branch head.
#
# MAINLINE REFS ARE EXEMPT, DELIBERATELY. `?ref=dev` / `?ref=main` asserting
# that a fix is live on the mainline is the merged-is-not-deployed discipline,
# not a defect -- the branch is never deleted and the assertion is a live
# readback by design. There are 8 such instances in the corpus; flagging them
# would be exactly the noise the Rule E block above warns makes a rule
# something the corpus learns to ignore. Short SHAs (>=7 hex) are immutable and
# exempt; runner-substituted refs (`${PRODUCT_HEAD}`) are judged by the runner,
# not here; `<branch>`-style placeholders inside prose examples are not refs.
#
# --- F3: an unanchored-cumulative count bound -------------------------------
# An EXACT or UPPER bound (`== N`, `<= N`, `-eq N`, `grep -qx N`) on a
# `search/issues` count whose result set only ever grows. The set is bounded
# only by a CLOSED date range (`created:A..B`) or by `is:open` (which drains as
# PRs close); a bare `created:>X` is open-ended and bounds nothing above.
# Corpus instances live in contracts/OMN-15192.yaml. That contract's own R32
# block records the class going RED on a legitimate head-refresh re-mint in
# contract-compliance run 30462434211 -- routine producer behaviour (OMN-14941)
# permanently falsifies the bound.
#
# LOWER bounds (`>= N`) are monotone-safe on a growing set and are NOT flagged.
# `N == 0` is excluded: asserting zero over a forward window is a real forward
# invariant, and the fail-open shape of zero-assertions is already Rule D's
# territory -- two rules firing on one line teaches nothing.

# A workflow run's LATEST-attempt job record is overwritten by a re-run, but the
# PER-ATTEMPT records are immutable: a re-run appends attempt N+1 and never
# rewrites attempt N. Verified live on the corpus' own instance (run

#
# so the attempt-1 `failure` the OMN-15484 evidence needs survives the re-run
# that erased it from the default (latest-only) view. Two spellings qualify:
#
#   a) `/actions/runs/<id>/attempts/<n>/jobs` -- the attempt is in the path.
#   b) `?filter=all` AND a `run_attempt` selector -- all attempts are returned
#      and one is selected.
#
# BOTH halves of (b) are required, deliberately. `select(.run_attempt==1)`
# WITHOUT `filter=all` is still a defect and stays flagged: the default endpoint
# returns only the latest attempt, so after a re-run the selector matches
# nothing, the producer emits no output, and `grep -qx` goes RED on empty input
# -- the same permanent block by a different route.

# OMN-15411 Rule E: SIGPIPE-fragile early-exit consumer (WARNING tier)
#
# `grep -q` exits at the FIRST match and closes its stdin. If the upstream
# stage still has bytes to write, it is killed by SIGPIPE and exits 141
# (128+13). omnimarket#1949 (OMN-15382) correctly moved the dod_verify command
# runner to `bash -o pipefail`, so that 141 now propagates as the pipeline's
# exit status -- a **false RED on genuinely-passing evidence**. The same
# command exits 0 when run outside pipefail, which is what makes the class so
# confusing in the field: the check reproduces green by hand and red in the
# runner.
#
# Whether a given pipeline is exposed depends on whether the producer still
# has unwritten output when grep exits -- i.e. on output volume relative to
# the pipe buffer, and on how many write syscalls the producer makes. That is
# not statically decidable, so this rule flags only producer shapes MEASURED
# to reproduce 141 against the corpus' own real inputs (5 runs each, under
# `bash -o pipefail -c`, 2026-07-29):
#
#   gh api <contents> --jq .content | base64 -d | grep -q ...   -> 141,0,141,0,141
#   gh pr diff <n> --repo <r>       | grep -q ...               -> 141,141,0,141,141
#   git log --oneline -200          | grep -q ...               -> 141 x5
#   find contracts -name '*.yaml'   | grep -q ...               -> 141 x5
#
# and shapes measured NOT to reproduce it, which this rule must NOT flag or it
# becomes noise the corpus learns to ignore:
#
#   gh pr view <n> --json state --jq .state | grep -qx MERGED   -> 0 x5
#   gh api .../pulls/<n> --jq '<scalar>'    | grep -qx true     -> 0 x5
#   find <single-receipt-dir> -type f       | grep -q .         -> 0 x5
#   cat <30KB file>                         | grep -q ...       -> 0 x5
#
# TIER 1 (`_SIGPIPE_FRAGILE_PRODUCERS`) is the ratcheted set: producers whose
# output size is unbounded by construction (a decoded file body, a PR diff, a
# git history walk, a paginated REST list, an iterating jq projection).
#
# TIER 2 (`_SIGPIPE_VOLUME_DEPENDENT_PRODUCERS`) is advisory only: `find`,
# `cat`, `rg`, `docker logs`, `uv run pytest` reproduce 141 on a large input
# and 0 on a small one. The corpus' 84 `find <one-receipt-dir> | grep -q .`
# instances are provably NOT exposed, so ratcheting tier 2 would freeze 85
# non-defects into a debt list.
#
# WARNING TIER, DELIBERATELY: this is a reliability foot-gun, not a fail-open
# hole -- a SIGPIPE false RED fails CLOSED (it blocks a Done flip; it never
# passes something that should fail). Per the ticket, Rule E does NOT change
# this linter's exit code. Growth of the class is stopped by the corpus
# ratchet in tests/unit/scripts/test_lint_contract_check_values_corpus_baseline.py,
# which DOES hard-fail on a new non-generated instance.
#
# The fail-closed replacement is a buffered read: assign the producer's output
# to a shell variable first, so it runs to completion and exits before anything
# reads from it, then pipe a printf of that variable into grep -qF. See the
# OCC#5496 and OCC#5523 repairs for the exact merged form.
